                <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees. The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</p>

                <p>The All India War Memorial, popularly known as the India Gate, is located along the Rajpath in New Delhi. The imposing structure of India Gate is an awe-inspiring sight and is often compared to the Arch de Triomphe in France, the Gateway of India in Mumbai and the Arch of Constantine in Rome. This 42-meter tall historical structure was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of the largest war memorials in the country.The India Gate was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC), which came into existence in December 1918 under the British rule for building war graves and memorials to soldiers who were killed in the First World War.The foundation stone of the gate then called the All India War Memorial, was laid on 10 February 1921, at 16:30, by the visiting Duke of Connaught in a ceremony attended by officers and men of the British Indian Army, Imperial Service Troops, the commander in chief, and Chelmsford, the viceroy. </p>

                <p>The Ram Bagh is said to have been constructed by Babur. It is commonly believed that when Babur died in 1530 his mortal remains were temporarily kept in Chaubureja a place close to Itimad-ud-Daula tomb till these were taken for the final resting place at Kabul.The first building on the site was a garden house built in 1835 for the wet nurse of prince Ram Singh II.In 1887, during the reign of Maharaja Thakur Sawai Madho Singh, it was converted into a modest royal hunting lodge, as the house was located in the midst of a thick forest at that time. In the early 20th century, it was expanded into a palace to the designs of Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob.Maharajah Sawai Man Singh II made Rambagh his principal residence and added a number of royal suites in 1931.</p>

The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage.In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.</p>
